### Description

The `super-hands` component interprets input from controls and
collision detection components
into interaction gestures and communicates those gestures to
target entities for them to respond.  

The currently implemented gestures are:

* Hover: Holding a controller in the collision space of an entity
* Grab: Pressing a button while hovering an entity, potentially also moving it
* Stretch: Grabbing an entity with two hands and resizing
* Drag-drop: Dragging an entity onto another entity

For an entity to respond to the `super-hands` gestures, it needs to have
components attached to translate the gestures into actions. `super-hands`
includes components for typical reactions to the implemented gestures:
`hoverable`, `clickable`, `grabbable`, `stretchable`, and `drag-droppable`.

**Avatar Locomotion**: Inspired by a demo from [@caseyyee](https://github.com/caseyyee), the `super-hands`
grab and stretch gestures can also serve as a comfortable locomotion system
by moving and scaling the world around the player. Use the `a-locomotor` primitive
to provide intuitive freedom of motion in your WebVR experiences.

**Mouse and Mobile VR Support**: With valuable input from [@milan-rusev](https://github.com/milan-rusev),
we were able to integrate mouse and other controller input via
the `cursor` component to support a wider variety of controllers.

[the examples](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/#mouse)
for more info.

### Concepts

![Separation of Gesture and Response API](readme_files/super-hands-api.png)

Separating the reaction to be the responsibility of the entity affected allows for extensibility.
In response to a grab, you may want some entities to lock to the controller and move,
others to rotate around a fixed point, and others still to spawn a new entity but remain unchanged.
With this API schema, these options can be handled by adding or creating different reaction
components to the entities in your scene, and `super-hands` can work with all of them.

#### Interactivity

There are two pathways to adding additional interactivity.

1. A-Frame style: Each component's API documentation describes the A-Frame
custom events and states it uses.
These are best processed by creating new A-Frame components that register
event listeners and react accordingly.
1. HTML style: The `super-hands` component also integrates with the
Global Event Handlers Web API to trigger standard mouse events analogous
to the VR interactions that can easily be handled through
properties like `onclick`.



### News

v1.1.0

* NEW: Compatibility with desktop mouse control via A-Frame `cursor` component
  * Added new schema property `colliderEventProperty` to configure
    where in the `event.details` to look for the collision target
  * Requires some configuration of schema properties, see new example: [Mouse Controls](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/#mouse)
* Select examples now have `avatar-replayer` to preview actions without needing
  VR equipment

v1.0.1

* A-Frame v0.6.0 compatibility: fixed issue with camera freezing when using
  `a-locomotor`'s automatic camera config
* Updated documentation and examples with latest versions of `aframe-extras` and
  `aframe-physics-system`.

v1.0.0

* `a-locomotor`: drop-in freedom of motion for WebVR experiences
  with this new primitive
* Maturation of A-Frame style API: Reaction components now need to cancel
  gesture events in order to communicate acceptance of the gesture to `super-hands`.
  This improves state tracking and handling of overlapping/nested
  entities
* Improved Global Event Handlers integration:
    * When overlapping entities create multiple potential targets for GEH
      events, the events fire on all potential targets
    * `click` now functions more like its mouse counterpart, only firing
      if a mouseup occurs after a mousedown and without losing collision
      with the target entity
* Two-handed grabbing: `grabbable` can now process grabs from multiple
  `super-hands` entities. In non-physics interactions, this makes passing
  entities between hands much easier. In physics-based interactions, this
  creates multiple constraints for advanced handling
* `strechable` flexibility: state tracking of hands attempting to
  stretch moved from `super-hands` to `strechable`. This should allow for
  different avatars in a multi-user setting to stretch a single entity
  cooperatively
* Added [machinima testing](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-machinima-testing)
  for automated testing based on motion-captured user input to improve
  regression detection

#### Known Issues

* When both hands are hovering an entity and one leaves, the entity will lose
  the hover state for one tick
  * Related to messaging from `sphere-collider`; unable to distinguish which
    collider instance is signaling the collision termination.
* Two-handed physics grabs don't feel great
  * Someone that knows something about game dev could be smarter about the
    constraints

### API

#### super-hands component

`super-hands` should be added to same entities as your controller
component and collision detector (e.g. [aframe-extras sphere-collider](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/misc)
or the in-development, physics system-based [physics-collider](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system/pull/14)).

##### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| colliderState | Name of state added to entities by your chosen collider | `'collided'` (default for `sphere-collider` and `physics-collider`) |
| colliderEvent | Event that your chosen collider emits when identifying a new collision | `'hit'` (default for `sphere-collider` and `physics-collider`) |
| colliderEventProperty | Name of property in event `details` object which contains the collided entity | `'el'` (default for `sphere-collider` and `physics-collider`) |
| grabStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate grab | Trigger, grip, thumb press events |
| grabEndButtons | Array of button event types that can terminate grab | Trigger, grip, thumb release events |
| stretchStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate stretch | Trigger, grip, thumb press events |
| stretchEndButtons | Array of button event types that can terminate stretch | Trigger, grip, thumb release events |
| dragDropStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate dragging/hovering | Trigger, grip, thumb press events |
| dragDropEndButtons | Array of button event types that can execute drag-drop | Trigger, grip, thumb release events |

Default button events include specific events for `vive-controls`, `hand-controls` and
`oculus-touch-controls`.

Default start events: 'gripdown', 'trackpaddown', 'triggerdown', 'gripclose',
'pointup', 'thumbup', 'pointingstart', 'pistolstart', 'thumbstickdown'

Default end events: 'gripup', 'trackpadup', 'triggerup', 'gripopen',
'pointdown', 'thumbdown', 'pointingend', 'pistolend', 'thumbstickup'

##### Events

Events will be emitted by the entity being interacted with.
The entity that `super-hands` is attached to is sent in the event `details` as the property `hand`.

| Type | Description | Target |  details object |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hover-start | Collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| hover-end | No longer collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| grab-start | Button pressed while collided with entity and hand is empty | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| grab-end | Button released after grab-start | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| stretch-start | Both controllers have button pressed while collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, secondHand: second controller entity |
| stretch-end | Release of button after stretch-start | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| drag-start | Drag-drop button pressed while collided with entity and hand is empty | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| drag-end | Drag-drop button released while dragging an entity | dragged entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| dragover-start | Collision with entity while dragging another entity | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, hovered: collided entity, carried: held entity |
| dragover-end | No longer collided with entity from dragover-start | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, hovered: collided entity, carried: held entity |
| drag-drop | Button released while holding an entity and collided with another | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, dropped: carried entity, on (carried entity only): receiving entity |

Notes:

* References to buttons being "released" and "pressed" are dependent on the schema settings.
For example, to make grab 'sticky', you could set grabStartButtons to
'triggerdown' and grabEndButtons to 'gripdown' (as in the
[sticky example](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/#sticky)).
This way the grab-end event would not fire until the grip button was *pressed*,
even if the trigger was *released* earlier.
* Only one entity at a time will be targeted for each event type,
even if multiple overlapping collision zones exist. `super-hands` tracks a
LIFO stack of collided entities to determine which will be affected.
* drag-drop: For the receiving entity, `on` entry in the details is `null`.
If needed, use `event.target` instead.

##### Global Event Handler Integration

| entity HTML attribute | conditions | event.relatedTarget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| onmouseover | hovering in an entity's collision zone | `super-hands` entity |
| onmouseout | leaving an entity's collision zone | `super-hands` entity |
| onmousedown | grab started while collided with entity | `super-hands` entity |
| onmouseup | grab ended while collided with entity | controller entity |
| onclick | grab started and then ended while collided with entity | controller entity |
| ondragstart | drag-drop started while collided with entity | controller entity |
| ondragend | drag-drop started while collided with entity | controller entity |
| ondragenter | hovering in an entity's collision zone while drag-dropping another entity | the other entity\* |
| ondragleave | leaving an entity's collision zone while drag-dropping another entity | the other entity\* |
| ondrop | drag-drop ended while holding an entity over a target | the other entity\* |

The event passed to the handler will be a `MouseEvent`. At present the only property implemented
is `relatedTarget`, which is set as
listed in the table. Drag-dropping events will be dispatched on both the entity being dragged and the drop target, and the `relatedTarget` property for each will point to the other entity in the interaction.

#### a-locomotor primitive

Add freedom of movement by wrapping the player avatar in an `a-locomotor` primitive.
Users can then grab and move the world around themselves to navigate your WebVR experience
in a way that is comfortable even for most people prone to simulation sickness.

The component works by enveloping the player in an invisible sphere that picks up
grabbing and stretching
gestures made on empty space and translates those into
movement and scaling for player avatar.
To function, the player camera and controllers must be children of `a-locomotor`,
and the controllers' colliders must be configured to collide with `a-locomotor`.
On initialization, `a-locomotor` will automatically re-parent the A-Frame
default camera and add itself to the `objects` property of `sphere-collider`
(see schema below if you want to disable this). With this automatic
configuration,
setting up `a-locomotor` simply requires wrapping your controller
entities like so:

```html
<a-locomotor>
  <a-entity hand-controls="left" super-hands sphere-collider></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="right" super-hands sphere-collider></a-entity>
</a-locomotor>
```

By default, `a-locomotor` gives the player the ability to move freely in the
horizontal plane and to scale up or down.
Behavior can be customized by setting the attributes below on the `a-locomotor`
entity.

##### Primitive Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| fetch-camera | Make the default camera a child of `a-locomotor` so it can be moved with the player | "true" |
| add-to-colliders | Ensure `a-locomotor` is visible to child entity `sphere-collider` components | "true" |
| allow-movement | Allow grabbing gestures to reposition the player | "true" |
| horizontal-only | Restrict movement to the X-Z plane | "true" |
| allow-scaling | Allow stretching gestures to rescale the player | "true" |

##### Events

| Type | Description | Target | Bubbles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 'locomotor-ready' | All auto-configuration steps complete | `a-locomotor` | yes |

#### hoverable component

Used to indicate when the controller is within range to interact with an entity
by adding the 'hovered' state. When using a mixin, including another mixin
in the assets withe same id + '-hovered' will activate automatically, as in
[the examples](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/).

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| hovered | Added to entity while it is collided with the controller |


#### grabbable component

Makes and entity move along with the controller while it is grabbed.

This works best with [aframe-physics-system](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system)
to manage grabbed entity movement, but it will fallback to manual `position` updates
(without rotational translation) if physics is not available or is disabled with `usePhysics = never`.

Allows for multiple hands to register a grab on an entity. In a non-physics setup, this has no effect
other than allowing smooth passing of entities between hands. With physics enabled, additional grabbing
hands register their own physics constraints to allow for two-handed wielding of entities. Limit or disable
by setting the maxGrabbers schema property.

##### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| usePhysics | Whether to use physics system constraints to handle movement, 'ifavailable', 'only', or 'never' | 'ifavailable' |
| maxGrabbers | Limit number of hands that can grab entity simultaneously | NaN (no limit) |
| invert | Reverse direction of entity movement compared to grabbing hand | false |
| suppressY | Allow movement only in the horizontal plane | false |

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| grabbed | Added to entity while it is being carried |

#### clickable component

An alternative version of `grabbable` that registers that a button was pressed, but does not
move the entity. Do not use `clickable` and `grabbable` on the same entity
(just use `grabbable` and watch the "grabbed" state instead of "clicked")

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clicked | Added to entity while a button is held down |

#### stretchable component

Makes and entity rescale while grabbed by both controllers as they are moved closer together or further apart.

##### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| usePhysics | Whether to update physics body shapes with scale changes, 'ifavailable' or 'never' | 'ifavailable' |
| invert | Reverse the direction of scaling in relation to controller movement | `false` |

There is no CANNON api method for updating physics body scale, but `stretchable` will manually rescale basic shapes. Currently rescalable shapes are: box.

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stretched | Added to entity while it is grabbed with two hands |

#### drag-droppable component

`drag-droppable` is a shell component that only manages the 'dragover' state for the entity.
This can be combined with  with a '-dragover' mixin to easily highlight when an entity is
hovering in a drag-drop location.

For interactivity, use the global event handler integration,
the `event-set` from [kframe](http://github.com/ngokevin/kframe)
with the `drag-dropped` event, or create your own component.

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dragover | Added to while a carried entity is colliding with a a `drag-droppable` entity |

Add `drag-droppable` to both the carried entity and the receiving entity if you want both of them to
receive the dragover state.
